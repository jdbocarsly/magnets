to do:
- format consistent navbar
- about page: details of calculations and names
- add structural and DOS covariants
- pull DOS from braid for predictions
- individual atom explorer app
- think about BVS?
- maybe deliver corr (and dosplots) as static?
- data table page (pandas? filterable?)
- alternate (shorter titles?), units/no units -- probably easiest as DF columns
- refactor styles into one master style, and other styles as necessary
- correlations on the main plot?

dosplot:
- cifs
- citations     
- aesthetics
- navbar
- reformat table to put units on left
- put words in a sensible order

corrplot:
- change/shorten names
- corrplot comes down below?

Ashby:
- switch button (switch x and y axes)
- suggested axis choices for main page
- colors for discrete categories on the main page
overall: 
-filter by elements? (
